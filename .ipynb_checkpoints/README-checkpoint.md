# A journey to PyConDe & PyData Berlin 2023
## Subtitle: A Topic Modeling 

As a first-time attendee of such a great conference, I would say I am so lucky to get the grant provided by the Diversity Committee. It made it possible for me to attend this event and gain valuable insights into the latest trends and innovations in the field and make connection to over 1200 people with same interets. That's amazing!

After backing from the event, I think it is a good to have a summary and also an overview of event. I think it's a good way to go through all the sessions by doing topic modelling.

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that extract hidden topics from text. The algorithm I am going to use is LDA.

Step 1 get the data - done
Step 2 tokenization 
Step 3
Step 4 Candidate topics
Step 5 Topic distribution
